# Experiment log

Running record of decisions and results. Append, never rewrite. Convert relative dates to
absolute. Every figure copied from the literature must be verified against its primary source
before it is relied on.

## 2026-10-06 — Project stood up

- Scaffolded the full package (`src/caesd/`): backbone + blocks A/B/C/D, metrics, calibration,
  data, train, eval, baselines. Environment: `uv` + Python 3.12, CUDA PyTorch on an RTX 3090 Ti.
- Metric suite built and unit-tested against known-answer identities (Cllr=1 for zero-info LLRs,
  EER=0 for separable scores, minCllr≤Cllr). Full numeric cross-check against BOSARIS / the
  ASVspoof5 eval package is still **to do** before any headline number is published.

## 2026-10-06 — Data pipeline + baselines

- **AASIST** cloned to `F:/datasets/audio/aasist`; pretrained weights load and score on the
  RTX 3090 Ti under torch 2.6. Bona-fide score = `logit[:,1]`; clips tiled to 64600 samples.
- **Sources verified** (web search, this date): In-the-Wild = HF `mueller91/In-The-Wild`
  (one 8.16 GB zip, English, bona/spoof); IndicSynth = HF `vdivyasharma/IndicSynth` (ACL 2025,
  845 GB total, 12 Indian languages, synthetic only — we pull a lean few-shard subset).
- **Downloading** (staged lean): In-the-Wild full + IndicSynth Telugu/Hindi/Tamil shards.
- Phase 1 measurement runner added (`eval/measure.py`, `scripts/phase1_measure.py`).
- Pipeline verified on synthetic scores end-to-end; 26 unit tests pass; ruff clean.

## Phase 0 — go / no-go (pending real data)

Pipeline is ready. Once In-the-Wild + the IndicSynth subset finish downloading:
1. `scripts/make_manifests.py` (or prepare step) → clean manifest, disjoint by speaker.
2. `scripts/build_condition_grid.py` → codec grid + condition labels.
3. `scripts/score_grid.py` → AASIST scores parquet.
4. `scripts/phase0_falsify.py` → the verdict below.

Record here, after the real run:

- [ ] Global-calibration gap (actDCF − minDCF) per condition and per language.
- [ ] Lookup-table closure on seen cells vs held-out codecs/languages.
- [ ] Threshold-transfer drift from clean dev to each held-out condition.
- [ ] **Decision:** GO / NO-GO, with the numbers that justify it.
